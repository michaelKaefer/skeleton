# Travis can cache content between builds. This speeds up the build process and saves resources.
cache:
  # With this option we can chose custom directories which should be cached between builds.
  directories:
    # Cache the directory where Symfony stores its slightly modified version of PHPUnit.
    - ./bin/.phpunit
    # Cache composer packages so "composer install" is faster.
    - $HOME/.composer/cache/files
    # Cache the Symfony binary so that it does not have to be reinstalled.
    - $HOME/.symfony

    # written to a directory that can be configured by the SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_DIR env var, or in

    # this env var in the phpunit.xml.dist file.
